## Dependencies
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Flask works with Python 2.7+) 

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/), a web application framework that's really easy for beginners. 
install flask with pip/pip3 by using
`pip install flask` or `pip3 install flask`

## Tools

You can use any IDE to run this, but [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is an IDE specifically made for Python development by JetBrains. 

## How to get started 

This repository contains the code covered in the Demo as well as the JSON request collection used to make requests.
